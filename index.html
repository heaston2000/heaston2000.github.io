              My name is Hugh Easton and I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science Student at Middlebury College.
		</p> 
		<p>
			My passion is for prediction. My work inside and outside of my studies revolves around
			everything from Machine Learning, to Probability and Math Modeling. The main topics I have worked in the science of prediction have
			been in:
			<ul> 
				<li> Climate Science</li>
				<li> Fluid Dynamics</li>
				<li> Natural Language Processing</li>
				<li> Survey Science</li>
				<li> And much more...</li>

		<font size="+1">Oratory Now</font> - <em>Oratory Coach</em> <br>
		<em> Feb. 2021 </em> - <br>
		I currently work as a public speaking coach with the group <a href="https://www.oratorynow.org/">Oratory Now</a>. 
		As a head coach, I coordinate teams of around 3-5 fellow students and a professor to lead public speaking workshops
		with the professor's class. Under Oratory Now, I was a Co-executive producer of the 2021 Parker Merrill Speech Competition,
		and also counsel students individually to prepare for speeches, debates and presentations.

		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Center for Teaching Learning and Research (CTLR)</font> - <em>Calculus Tutor</em>
		<br><em> Sep. 2022 </em> - <br>
		I am a Calculus tutor for both Calc I and II classes through the Middlebury CTLR. This entails coordinating with around 2-4 students who sign up each week 
		for individual tutoring, and leading a drop-in teaching in Calc II session for around a dozen students each Tuesday.<br>

		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Department of Earth and Climate Sciences</font> - <em>Research Assistant</em><br>
		<em> Feb. - Oct. 2022 </em> <br>
		I worked as a research assistant under Professor <a href="https://www.ajacobel.com/">Allison Jacobel</a> working on 
		a Neural Network for Predicting Sea-Surface Temperature during the Last Glacial Maximum.
		Training on a modern dataset of foraminifera skeletons (Forams) from the 
		ocean floor and corresponding sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), that was previously labeled outdated for prediction, we 
		used Commercial Neural Network Generating software to create a model for predicting Sea-Surface temperatures based on 
		work done by Kucera <em> et al.</em> (2005). 
		After using the software which abstracted away much of the network architecture, I coded my own Deep Neural Network using 
		<strong>PyTorch</strong>,
		and the same data with remote access to Middlebury's high-performance computing cluster. 
		Work on this project also involved using <strong> Excel </strong> to clean normalize and merge the Foram and SST data,
		<strong> R </strong> to merge, clean and vizualize the final predictions for the Last Glacial Maximum Predictions,
		and <strong> matplotlib </strong> for visualizing the entire process.<br>
		Python work on this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/heaston2000/NNforSSTfromForams">here</a>.

	<p>
		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Department of Mathematics</font> - <em>Research Assistant</em><br>
		<em> May - Aug. 2021 </em> <br>
		I worked under Professor <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/people/michaela-kubacki">Michaela Kubacki</a> in research for
		Machine Learning techniques in Computational Fluid Dynamics. In particular, I worked with a team of two other students to create
		a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting the pressure and velocity fields around a two-dimensional obstacle
		in a channel of fluid flow given an 2-D image of the obstacle's shape. After completing that network, I worked by myself
		under the same professor to create another CNN, this time for predicting the drag coefficient of a 2-D obstacle in a channel
		given an image of that obstacle.
		<br> The Flow Field CNN we worked on in MATLAB can be found <a href="https://github.com/youtao1999/CNN-CFD">here</a>, 
		and the Drag CNN can be found

		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Department of Computer Science</font> - <em>Remote Grader</em><br>
		<em> Feb. - May 2022 </em> <br>
		I graded homework for two CS 301 (Theory of Computation) classes at Middlebury. My work consisted of marking up around 15 homeworks 
		per week that students had submitted in topics from models of computation (finite automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines) to 
		deterministic versus non-deterministic computation, and a theoretical basis for the study of NP-completeness.

		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Activities Board</font> - <em>Student Technical Assistant</em><br>
		<em> Feb. - May 2021 </em> <br>
		I worked setting up and running lighting and sound for Middlebury concerts and shows. My work included experience with stage 
		lighting and soundboards,
		including AUX, XLR, MIDI, TS and TRS audio systems.

		<font size="+1">Emerson Green/NOW Communities LLC</font> - <em>Construction Assistant</em><br>
		<em> Apr. - Aug. 2020 </em> <br>
		I worked on the housing development <a href="https://www.emersongreen.com/">Emerson Green</a> in Devens, Massachusetts during the 
		summer of 2020. I worked under a general contractor coordinating between and helping them and sub-contractor execute various tasks.
		My role included instituting COVID-19 safety policies on the site. Since I was working under various sub-contractors, each with a different trade,
		this experience made me efficient at absorbing exactly what I needed to do from experts in all sorts of fields.

		<font size="+1">Middlebury College Diabilities Resource Center</font> - <em>Student Lecture Secretary</em><br>
		<em> Feb. - May 2020 </em> <br>
		I was tasked with taking detailed notes for students who needed accommodation in two Computer Science classes.

	<p> 
		<font size="+1">Concord Academy Summer Camp</font> - <em>Camp Counselor</em><br>
		<em> Jun. - Aug. 2019 </em> <br>
		Before starting classes at Middlebury, I worked as a day camp counselor for the 
		<a href="https://concordacademy.org/summer-camp/">local summer camp</a> in town.
		Skills I have taken away from this experience are dealing with high-stress situations
		and coordinating with a wide-variety of staff, from administrators, to fellow counselors and healthcare workers.

	<p>
		<font size="+1">Dunkin Donuts</font> - <em>Cashier/Server</em><br>
		<em> Aug. 2017 - Sep. 2018 </em> <br>
		During high school, I worked at my local Dunkin Donuts. 
		Dunkin taught me stamina, the importance of being efficient and prompt with my work, and to prioritize and execute 
		seemingly endless lists of tasks.
